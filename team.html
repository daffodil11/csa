    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>Mr Cats is a bit of a geek with a passion for game design. He likes to think of himself as a 'creative individual', but all that really means is he just talks at length about ideas that he rarely ever makes into a reality.</p>
    <h4>Graphics</h4>
    <p>Mike Little is a simple man who enjoys vector graphics, classic rock and wearing women's clothing. (One of those statements is a lie.)</p>
    <p>Mrey is predominately a 3D artist, but when the call goes out, he’s there to help out on any game. His life is pretty much games, games, games and when he’s not playing games it’s down to work on the latest project to bring his ideas to life on screen.</p>
    <h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>Sam Davies is a programmer, cook and pseudonym from the UK. His interests include being fictional, and he hopes one day to mask the identity of someone important.</p>
    <h4>Audio</h4>
    <p>Luca is a genderless entity with ears. His right shoulderblade is highly regarded to be her best feature.</p>
